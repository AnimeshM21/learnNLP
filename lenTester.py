text = "The current methods of misinformation detection like Machine Learning and NLP methods or crowdsourcing among other such methods which are not scalable or are inconsistent. So to solve this problem this paper investigates the use of provenance data to track the origins and changes of information, with the goal of creating automated tools to better detect and control the spread of fake news on social media . The innovative approach, to track provenance data , to see how a piece of information has been transformed from source to destination. The paper details a misinformation detection algorithm that evaluates social media data by calculating a “distance from positivity” metric. As shown in the paper, this solution is scalable and integrates well with social network data at scale , which is also applicable to large-scale social-networks. The paper further incorporates the concept of “collaborative wisdom,” by separating user feedback into positive and negative feedback, sometimes overlooking more complex behaviors and opinions. As the proposed solution has been trained and evaluated on a synthetic social provenance dataset, it lacks being tested on real-world social media data, limiting its practical applicability.  Also the immediate use-case of the proposed solution is constrained by the fact that social media companies currently do not provide access to the provenance data on their platforms. The results from this study could be used to train a Machine Learning model for misinformation detection. This could further enhance accuracy by combining the provenance-based approach with advanced data-driven techniques. "
